## Git Layout

There will be **6 total** branches:

* `dev` branch - this branch should have the development version of the code from our own branches. For ex. if you're working on a new feature and would like to share it with us then you should push it to this branch and then check if it works and then we will pull this branch into our own branch.
* `master` branch - this branch should ALWAYS have working code. Ideally pushed from the `dev` branch once everything is tested. This way, we can also be confident that `master` will have the latest code.
* The rest are branches with `your-name`. This is where we will do our own individual stuff. Once we are done, we should push to `dev` so others can pull from it. Similiarly, we should pull from dev if others have pushed something to it.

### Tags

We should also make use of tags and such as the prof explained.
